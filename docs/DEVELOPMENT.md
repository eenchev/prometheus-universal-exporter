# Development

```sh
make fmt        # rewrite the whole tree with gofmt, tools/ included
make fmt-check  # fail if any source needs gofmt
make lint       # golangci-lint, same configuration as CI
make test       # go test ./..., then with -race, twice, in a random order
make vet
make build      # every request type; REQUEST_TYPES=http builds only those listed
make helm-test  # helm lint and the template scenarios CI renders
make ci         # everything above, in CI order

make test-external  # opt-in; probes real third-party endpoints
```

## Repeatable tests

Every test must pass however many times it runs and in whatever order, which
`make test` and CI check with `go test -race -count=2 -shuffle=on ./...`. A
failure there names the seed it used; run it again with `-shuffle=<seed>`.

State shared across tests is what breaks this. The Python worker pool is one
such thing: its counts — starts, runs, stops, idle workers — would carry over
from test to test. A test that runs Python calls `requirePython(t)`, which also
gives it a pool of its own and stops that pool's workers when it ends; a test
that uses the pool without an interpreter calls `usePythonPool(t)`. Tests
therefore must not use `t.Parallel`, which the swap assumes.

## The configuration schema

`config.schema.json`, and `collector-file.schema.json` for
[collector files](CONFIGURATION.md#collector-files), are generated from the
configuration structs. After adding or changing a configuration key, regenerate
both, or the test suite fails:

```sh
go run . --config.schema > config.schema.json
go run . --config.collector-file-schema > collector-file.schema.json
```

Allowed values, patterns and descriptions that a struct cannot express are added
by path in `configSchemaRules` in `configschema.go`.

## Tests that reach the internet

`make ci` never touches the network. The demo configurations under `testdata/`
describe real services, though, and a stub replaying a captured response cannot
tell you when one of those services renames a field or a column: the local
tests go on passing while the shipped configuration quietly stops working.

`external_e2e_test.go` closes that gap by probing the real endpoints, and it is
off unless asked for:

```sh
EXTERNAL_E2E=1 go test -run TestExternal -v ./...
# or
make test-external
```

Without `EXTERNAL_E2E` the tests skip with a message saying how to run them, so
`go test ./...` stays offline and deterministic. They are deliberately not in
CI: a red build caused by somebody else's afternoon outage teaches everyone to
ignore red builds. Run them when changing a demo configuration, and every so
often to catch a source that has moved on.

A failure here usually means the service changed or is unreachable rather than
that this code broke, and the assertions say so — they check that the probe
returned 200, that each metric the configuration declares is present, and that
the per-row or per-entry labels survived.

The suite also holds the status page demo's detailed tests,
`grafanastatus_external_e2e_test.go`, which run its configuration against a
captured copy of status.grafana.com's summary. They need no network but are
opt-in like the rest.
A test file joins the suite by being listed in `externalgate_test.go`; every test
in it must be named `TestExternal*`, so `make test-external` picks it up, and
start with `requireExternalE2E(t)`. `TestExternalSuiteTestsAreOptIn`, which
does run by default, fails when either is missing.

Static analysis is configured in `.golangci.yml`, so a local `make lint` and the
CI run check exactly the same rules. Install the pinned version with `make
lint-install`; the Makefile and the CI workflow pin the same version, and a test
keeps them in step.

That pin is coupled to the Go toolchain in a way worth knowing about.
golangci-lint ships as a binary built with a particular Go release, and its type
checker cannot read standard-library sources from a newer one — run an older
build against a newer toolchain and it does not report a lint failure, it panics
with `file requires newer Go version go1.27 (application built with go1.25)`.
Since the build uses the current stable Go, the pinned linter has to be a
release built with at least that. When Go ships a new minor, golangci-lint needs
bumping with it. Beyond the standard linters it enables `bodyclose`, `errorlint`,
`gocritic`, `gosec`, `misspell`, `nilerr`, `noctx`, `perfsprint`, `revive`,
`unconvert` and `usestdlibvars`. The repository is gofmt-clean and CI fails on
unformatted sources rather than rewriting them.

`make test` also validates the GitHub Actions workflows: `workflows_test.go`
decodes every file under `.github/workflows` with a parser that rejects
duplicate mapping keys, and checks that each step sets exactly one of `run` or
`uses` and uses no unknown keys. GitHub refuses to create a run for a workflow
it cannot parse, which produces no jobs at all, so a CI step cannot catch that
mistake in the commit that introduces it — the checker would be in the file
GitHub is refusing to read. Running the tests before pushing is what protects
you.

It validates the chart templates the same way. `charts_test.go` checks that
every manifest a template renders begins its own YAML document. A template that
renders more than one manifest — several declared, or one wrapped in a range —
needs a `---` before each, and neither `helm lint` nor `helm template` notices a
missing one: helm prints whatever the template produced, so two manifests merge
into a single document and the chart only fails when someone applies it.
`helm-test` and CI render the chart with monitors enabled and additionally fail
when the number of manifests exceeds the number of documents the output parses
into.

A few `gosec` findings are deliberate and are suppressed narrowly, with the
reason stated at the suppression: `request.tls.insecure_skip_verify` is a
documented opt-in, and the exporter necessarily reads the configuration, target
document and credential files whose paths the operator supplies (G304).

Two more are scoped to the single file each applies to rather than excluded
globally. G704 reports the outbound request as server-side request forgery,
which is an accurate description of what this program is — an exporter whose job
is to fetch a URL an operator supplied — so it is excluded on `fetcher.go` only,
with the exposure bounded by the scheme allowlist, the response size limit and
the operator's own target allowlist. G703 reports the Dockerfile path that
`tools/depupdate` takes on the command line as attacker-controlled; that is a
developer tool with no untrusted caller, so it is excluded under `tools/`.

## The Go toolchain

CI and the release workflows ask setup-go for `stable`, so the build always uses
the current stable Go release and no workflow needs editing when Go ships a new
one. The `go` directive in `go.mod` is something different: it is the *minimum*
the module requires, raised by dependency updates rather than by whichever
toolchain builds it, so it stays where the dependencies put it. The Dockerfile
pins `GO_VERSION` to a released minor, which `tools/depupdate` keeps moving
within the major.

The two can drift apart in a way that is hard to read: a dependency bump raises
the go directive in a pull request that touches no workflow, and from then on
every build fails with `go.mod requires go >= X` with nothing nearby to explain
it. `goversion_test.go` ties them together — it checks that every Go version the
workflows request, and the one the Dockerfile pins, satisfies the go directive —
so `go test ./...` catches the mismatch instead of the next red build.

GitHub Actions uses changed-path detection: Go tests/build/vet/race checks run
for Go source or module changes, while Helm lint/template checks run for changes
under `charts/`. A change under `charts/` runs the Go suite too, because the
template guard above lives there and is worth least on exactly the changes that
would break it. Documentation-only changes do not run either suite.
