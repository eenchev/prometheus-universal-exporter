# Target requests

Everything on this page describes the request the exporter makes to the
discovered target, not the scrape Prometheus makes of the exporter. Each setting
lives on a collector's `request` block, and most can be overridden for a single
scrape through a `/probe` query parameter — which is what a monitor's `params`
map renders into.

## Redirects and HTTP/2

Two transport settings live on the collector request, both off by default:

```yaml
request:
  follow_redirects: false
  enable_http2: false
```

`follow_redirects` decides whether a redirect status on the target request is
followed. Left at `false`, the exporter returns the redirect response itself, so
the collector sees the 3xx status and — with the default `on_http_error: fail` —
the probe fails. That is deliberate: a target that has moved is worth noticing
rather than quietly scraping somewhere else. Set it to `true` for endpoints that
legitimately redirect, such as an API whose documented host forwards to another.

`enable_http2` decides whether the target request may negotiate HTTP/2. HTTP/2
is negotiated through ALPN over TLS, so this only affects HTTPS targets;
cleartext HTTP/2 is never attempted. The default of `false` is the protocol the
exporter has always used.

Both are overridable per scrape:

```yaml
params:
  follow_redirects: ["true"]
  enable_http2: ["true"]
```

Each accepts exactly `true` or `false`; anything else returns HTTP 400 before
the target is contacted, so a typo cannot quietly fall back to a default. An
absent parameter leaves the collector's setting in force, and both parameters
are part of the response cache key, so a scrape asking for different transport
behaviour never reads another scrape's cached result. Scheduled targets accept
both in their own `request` block.

These replace the earlier undocumented `request.redirect_policy`. A
configuration still setting it now fails to load with an unknown-field error
rather than silently changing behaviour.

## Retries

Retries can be configured in the collector and overridden for one scrape:

```yaml
request:
  retry:
    attempts: 2   # retries after the initial request
    backoff: 2s   # fixed delay between attempts
```

The exporter retries transport failures and transient HTTP responses (`408`,
`425`, `429`, and `5xx`). Other HTTP statuses are returned immediately. The
retry count and fixed delay can be overridden for one scrape with the
`retry_attempts` and `retry_backoff` probe parameters. Retries share the scrape/target
timeout, so the retry loop cannot extend the configured deadline indefinitely.

## TLS

The collector can configure target TLS verification and trust material:

```yaml
request:
  tls:
    ca_file: /etc/prometheus/tls/ca.crt
    cert_file: /etc/prometheus/tls/client.crt
    key_file: /etc/prometheus/tls/client.key
    insecure_skip_verify: false
```

For a one-off scrape, the `insecure_skip_verify` probe parameter overrides the
collector setting. Set it to `true` only for endpoints where certificate
verification is intentionally unavailable; it disables server certificate
verification and should not be used as a general workaround.

```yaml
params:
  insecure_skip_verify: ["true"]
```
